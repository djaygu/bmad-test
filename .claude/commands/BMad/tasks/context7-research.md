# Context7 Research Task

## Purpose

Context7 is a systematic methodology for researching APIs, libraries, frameworks, and technologies to ensure comprehensive understanding and proper implementation decisions.

## When to Use

- Researching new APIs or libraries for implementation
- Evaluating technology choices for architecture decisions
- Understanding integration patterns and best practices
- Investigating compatibility and version requirements

## Context7 Research Framework

### 1. Context: Understand the Problem Space
- What specific problem are we trying to solve?
- What are the requirements and constraints?
- What is the broader system context?
- What are the performance, security, and scalability needs?

### 2. Options: Identify Available Solutions
- Research available libraries, frameworks, or APIs
- Consider multiple alternatives and approaches
- Document pros and cons of each option
- Check community adoption and maintenance status

### 3. Nuances: Deep Dive into Details
- Read official documentation thoroughly
- Understand API surface area and capabilities
- Identify limitations, gotchas, and edge cases
- Review breaking changes and migration paths

### 4. Trade-offs: Analyze Costs and Benefits
- Performance implications
- Learning curve and development complexity
- Maintenance burden and long-term viability
- Licensing and cost considerations
- Bundle size and dependency impact

### 5. Examples: Study Real-World Usage
- Find official examples and demos
- Review community examples and patterns
- Study how similar projects solve the problem
- Identify common implementation patterns

### 6. Integration: Plan Implementation Strategy
- How will this integrate with existing codebase?
- What changes are needed to current architecture?
- What testing strategies are appropriate?
- What migration or rollback plans are needed?

### 7. Testing: Validate the Research
- Create proof-of-concept or spike
- Test integration with existing systems
- Validate performance and compatibility claims
- Document lessons learned and recommendations

## Research Output Format

When completing Context7 research, provide:

1. **Problem Statement**: Clear definition of what we're solving
2. **Recommended Solution**: Primary choice with rationale
3. **Alternative Options**: Other viable solutions considered
4. **Implementation Plan**: Step-by-step integration approach
5. **Risk Assessment**: Potential issues and mitigation strategies
6. **Testing Strategy**: How to validate the implementation
7. **Documentation**: Key resources and references

## Integration with Development Workflow

- Use Context7 before implementing any new external dependencies
- Document research findings in story Dev Notes
- Share findings with team for validation before proceeding
- Update technical preferences with lessons learned
