# Product Requirements Document: SPX Options Data Pipeline Tool

## Document Information

- **Product Name**: SPX Options Data Pipeline Tool
- **Version**: 1.0 (MVP)
- **Date**: December 2024
- **Document Owner**: Product Manager
- **Status**: Draft for Development

## Executive Summary

### Product Overview

The SPX Options Data Pipeline Tool is a CLI-based data acquisition system built entirely on Effect-TS, designed to reliably download SPX options data from ThetaData API and prepare it for backtesting analysis. The product implements a streaming pipeline architecture that processes data through memory-efficient NDJSON temporary files and stores results as integrity-validated parquet files, all while providing comprehensive operational control through Effect CLI commands.

### Problem Statement

Quantitative trading research requires high-quality historical options data for backtesting strategies, but acquiring this data reliably presents critical challenges:

- **Data Acquisition Reliability**: API calls fail due to rate limits, network issues, or service downtime
- **Memory and Resource Management**: SPX options generate large volumes of tick data that overwhelm system memory
- **Data Integrity Assurance**: Downloaded data can be corrupted during transfer or storage with no easy detection
- **Operational Visibility**: Long-running data collection processes require monitoring and control capabilities

### Solution Overview

The SPX Options Data Pipeline Tool solves these problems through:

- **Streaming-Based Architecture**: Memory-efficient processing using Effect-TS streams and temporary file staging
- **Intelligent Gap Analysis**: Automated detection of missing trading days with orchestrated catch-up processing
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Typed error hierarchy with intelligent retry strategies using Effect.retry
- **Rich CLI Interface**: Operational controls for monitoring, status checking, and failure recovery
- **Data Integrity Validation**: Atomic parquet writes with checksum validation at every stage

### Value Propositions

1. **"Set It and Forget It" Operation**: Automated processing with comprehensive error recovery eliminates manual intervention
2. **Memory-Efficient Local Processing**: Handles large datasets on M4 MacBook Pro hardware without memory exhaustion
3. **Operational Excellence**: Rich CLI provides complete visibility and control over long-running data processes
4. **Data Quality Assurance**: Multiple validation layers ensure research integrity through checksum validation and atomic operations
5. **Developer-Friendly Architecture**: Effect-TS patterns enable reliable, maintainable code with excellent testing capabilities
