# Story 1.1.1: Testing Framework Migration

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** software developer,  
**I want** to migrate the testing framework from Bun test to Vitest,  
**so that** I have better testing capabilities, debugging support, and alignment with Effect-TS ecosystem best practices.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All existing tests pass with Vitest instead of Bun test runner
2. Test configuration is updated to use Vitest with proper Effect-TS integration
3. Package.json scripts are updated to use Vitest commands (test, test:watch, test:coverage)
4. All documentation references to Bun testing are updated to reflect Vitest
5. Architecture documents are updated to specify Vitest in the technology stack
6. PRD technical specifications are updated to reflect the testing framework change
7. Development workflow remains unchanged for developers (same npm/bun run commands)
8. Test coverage reporting works correctly with Vitest
9. Watch mode and debugging capabilities are functional and improved over Bun

## Dev Notes

### Current Testing Infrastructure
[Source: Existing implementation in Story 1.1]
- **Current Framework**: Bun test runner with native TypeScript support
- **Test Files**: Located in `tests/` directory matching source structure
- **Existing Tests**: 79 tests with 344 assertions covering configuration, repository, and validation logic
- **Test Commands**: `bun test`, `bun test --watch` currently in use

### Effect-TS Testing Patterns
[Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md and existing test implementations]
- **Effect Testing**: Use Effect.gen() with mock services using Effect.provide()
- **Async Operations**: All tests must use Effect.runPromise for async operations
- **Mock Services**: Effect mock services pattern for dependency injection testing
- **Test Structure**: describe/it pattern with Effect testing utilities

### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/technology-stack.md]
- **Current Dependencies**: @effect/cli@0.36.x, @effect/schema@0.67.x, @effect/sql-sqlite
- **Runtime**: Bun as primary runtime with native TypeScript support
- **Testing Integration**: Need Vitest configuration that works with Bun runtime
- **Path Aliases**: tsconfig.json has aliases (@/, @cli/, @infrastructure/) that must work in tests

### Testing Standards from Previous Story
[Source: Story 1.1 implementation]
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 90% code coverage requirement
- **Test Location**: Tests adjacent to implementation following TDD pattern
- **Property Testing**: Use fast-check for edge cases and validation testing
- **Integration Tests**: Test CLI commands with real database in memory
- **Error Testing**: Comprehensive error handling and validation message testing

### Migration Considerations
- **Vitest Benefits**: Better debugging, watch mode, UI dashboard, broader ecosystem support
- **Effect-TS Compatibility**: Vitest has better Effect-TS community support than Bun test
- **Configuration Complexity**: Need proper path alias resolution and Effect service mocking
- **Performance**: Vitest should maintain or improve test execution speed
- **Developer Experience**: Enhanced debugging and watch capabilities

### Testing
**Test File Location**
- Follow TDD pattern with tests adjacent to implementation
- Test structure: `tests/` directory matching `src/` structure exactly
- Example: `src/cli/commands/config.ts` → `tests/cli/commands/config.test.ts`

**Testing Frameworks and Patterns**
- **Primary Framework**: Vitest with Effect-TS integration
- **Test Structure**: Use describe/it pattern with Effect testing utilities
- **Async Testing**: All Effect operations must use Effect.runPromise() for proper async handling
- **Mock Services**: Use Effect.provide() pattern for dependency injection testing
- **Property Testing**: Use fast-check library for validation edge cases and property-based testing

**Effect-TS Specific Testing Requirements**
- **Service Testing**: Mock Effect services using Effect.provide() with test implementations
- **Error Testing**: Test Effect error handling with proper Either/Exit pattern testing
- **CLI Testing**: Test CLI commands with real database in memory using Effect testing utilities
- **Schema Testing**: Test Effect Schema validation with both valid and invalid inputs

**Test Coverage Requirements**
- **Minimum Coverage**: 90% code coverage for all components
- **Critical Path Coverage**: 100% coverage for configuration, validation, and error handling logic
- **Integration Coverage**: All CLI commands must have integration tests
- **Error Path Coverage**: All error conditions must be tested with proper error message validation

**Vitest Configuration Standards**
- **Configuration File**: `vitest.config.ts` with TypeScript support
- **Path Aliases**: Must support tsconfig.json path aliases (@/, @cli/, @infrastructure/)
- **Coverage Provider**: Use @vitest/coverage-v8 for accurate coverage reporting
- **Watch Mode**: Configure proper file watching for development workflow

**Specific Testing Requirements for This Story**
- **Migration Validation**: All existing 79 tests must pass without modification to test logic
- **Framework Compatibility**: Verify Effect testing patterns work identically with Vitest
- **Performance Baseline**: Test execution time should not regress from Bun test performance
- **Debug Capability**: Verify improved debugging experience with Vitest
