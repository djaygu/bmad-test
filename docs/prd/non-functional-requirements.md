# Non-Functional Requirements

## NFR-1: Performance Requirements

### NFR-1.1: Processing Throughput
- **Requirement**: System must process at least 50,000 records per minute during active data acquisition
- **Rationale**: Ensures reasonable processing time for full trading day datasets
- **Measurement**: Records processed divided by total processing time (excluding API wait time)
- **Target Environment**: M4 MacBook Pro with 48GB RAM

### NFR-1.2: Memory Efficiency
- **Requirement**: System must process full trading day of SPX options data while using less than 50% of available system memory (24GB on 48GB system)
- **Rationale**: Prevents memory exhaustion on local hardware and allows concurrent system usage
- **Measurement**: Peak memory usage during processing measured via system monitoring
- **Implementation**: Streaming architecture with per-expiration batching

### NFR-1.3: Response Time
- **Requirement**: CLI commands must respond within specified time limits:
  - Status commands: < 2 seconds
  - Gap analysis: < 5 seconds for 2+ years of data
  - Configuration commands: < 1 second
  - Health checks: < 3 seconds
- **Rationale**: Enables interactive CLI usage without frustrating delays
- **Measurement**: Command execution time from invocation to completion

### NFR-1.4: Disk I/O Efficiency
- **Requirement**: System must efficiently manage temporary files and output generation:
  - Temporary file creation/deletion: < 1 second per file
  - Parquet conversion: < 30 seconds per expiration
  - Disk space monitoring: < 500ms per check
- **Rationale**: Prevents I/O bottlenecks from limiting processing throughput
- **Measurement**: File operation timing and disk utilization monitoring

## NFR-2: Reliability Requirements

### NFR-2.1: Processing Reliability
- **Requirement**: System must successfully download and process assigned trading days with less than 1% failure rate requiring manual intervention
- **Rationale**: Ensures "set it and forget it" operation for historical data acquisition
- **Measurement**: (Successful processing attempts / Total processing attempts) Ã— 100
- **Implementation**: Comprehensive error handling with intelligent retry strategies

### NFR-2.2: Data Integrity
- **Requirement**: Zero corrupted parquet files reach final storage through atomic write and checksum validation process
- **Rationale**: Ensures data quality for reliable backtesting results
- **Measurement**: File integrity verification through checksum validation
- **Implementation**: Atomic file operations with SHA-256 checksum generation and validation

### NFR-2.3: Recovery Time
- **Requirement**: Failed downloads must be identifiable and retryable within 5 minutes of failure detection through CLI commands
- **Rationale**: Enables rapid recovery from transient issues without manual investigation
- **Measurement**: Time from failure occurrence to successful retry initiation
- **Implementation**: Real-time error detection with immediate CLI availability

### NFR-2.4: Gap Detection Accuracy
- **Requirement**: Automated gap analysis must correctly identify 100% of missing trading days when comparing configured date ranges against processed data log
- **Rationale**: Ensures complete dataset coverage without manual date management
- **Measurement**: Manual verification of gap analysis against known market calendar
- **Implementation**: Market calendar integration with comprehensive date validation

## NFR-3: Usability Requirements

### NFR-3.1: CLI Interface Clarity
- **Requirement**: All CLI commands must provide clear help text, parameter validation, and error messages that enable self-service operation
- **Rationale**: Reduces learning curve and operational overhead for quantitative researchers
- **Measurement**: User testing and documentation completeness review
- **Implementation**: Comprehensive help system with examples and validation messages

### NFR-3.2: Configuration Management
- **Requirement**: System configuration must be discoverable, validatable, and persist across system restarts
- **Rationale**: Enables reliable operation without repeated manual setup
- **Measurement**: Configuration persistence testing and validation coverage
- **Implementation**: SQLite-based configuration storage with schema validation

### NFR-3.3: Operational Visibility
- **Requirement**: Processing status, progress, and error information must be accessible through CLI commands at any time
- **Rationale**: Enables monitoring and troubleshooting of long-running processes
- **Measurement**: Information completeness and real-time accuracy verification
- **Implementation**: Comprehensive status tracking with real-time updates

### NFR-3.4: Error Reporting
- **Requirement**: Error messages must include sufficient context for diagnosis and provide actionable remediation steps
- **Rationale**: Enables self-service troubleshooting without developer intervention
- **Measurement**: Error message quality assessment and resolution success rate
- **Implementation**: Structured error types with detailed context and remediation guidance

## NFR-4: Maintainability Requirements

### NFR-4.1: Code Quality Standards
- **Requirement**: All code must follow Effect-TS best practices with comprehensive type safety and error handling
- **Rationale**: Ensures long-term maintainability and reliability
- **Measurement**: Code review compliance and type coverage analysis
- **Implementation**: Effect-TS patterns with strict TypeScript configuration

### NFR-4.2: Test Coverage
- **Requirement**: System must maintain greater than 90% test coverage across unit, integration, and property-based tests
- **Rationale**: Enables confident refactoring and feature enhancement
- **Measurement**: Automated test coverage reporting
- **Implementation**: TDD approach with Effect-TS testing utilities

### NFR-4.3: Documentation Standards
- **Requirement**: All modules, functions, and CLI commands must include comprehensive documentation
- **Rationale**: Enables efficient development and operational support
- **Measurement**: Documentation coverage analysis and review
- **Implementation**: Automated documentation generation with manual review

### NFR-4.4: Configuration Externalization
- **Requirement**: All runtime configuration must be externalized through environment variables or configuration files
- **Rationale**: Enables deployment flexibility and operational control
- **Measurement**: Configuration coverage analysis
- **Implementation**: Effect Config integration with comprehensive validation
