# Risk Mitigation

## Data Loss Prevention
- **Atomic Writes**: Complete file writes or rollback
- **Checksum Validation**: Detect corruption immediately
- **Retry Logic**: Intelligent retry with exponential backoff
- **Manual Recovery**: CLI commands for failure recovery

## System Resilience  
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue processing other dates if one fails
- **Resource Management**: Effect ensures proper cleanup on failure
- **Error Isolation**: Failures contained to specific processing units
- **Manual Override**: CLI controls for manual intervention

## API Reliability
- **Rate Limit Compliance**: Respect ThetaData API constraints
- **Connection Retry**: Automatic retry for transient failures
- **Error Classification**: Different strategies for different error types
- **Manual Fallback**: CLI commands for manual data acquisition
